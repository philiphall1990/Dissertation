abook FAQ
~~~~~~~~~

Q: Can I recall the old value in editor?

A: Yes, use up arrow to recall the old value.


Q: How to query all addresses when I press 'Q' in mutt?

A: Type "all" to the prompt.


Q: Can I mark multiple addresses in mutt after a query?

A: You can tag addresses with 't'. When ready, type ";m" (press first ';'
   and then 'm') and all tagged addresses will appear to your "To:"
   line.


Q: How to insert an address (or many) with abook when I'm forwarding
   a message in mutt? ("To:" and "Cc:" prompts)

A: When "To:" or "Cc:" prompt appears press ^t for query. (After query
   you can tag multiple addresses with 't')


Q: Can I add addresses to the abook addressbook from mutt?

A: Yes, it is possible starting from abook version 0.4.15. See --add-email
   command line option and README.


Q: How can I import my abook entries to my PalmOS addressbook?

A: Export to palmcsv format, and import from there. Several GUI
   applications such as jpilot can do this, but the simplest way is to
   use pilot-addresses from the pilot-link package. Just export to
   addresses.palmcsv, then run this:
                                                                                
   pilot-addresses -d abook -c abook -r addresses.palmcsv
                                                                                
   This will delete everything in the abook category and replace it with
   the latest information from your abook database. By keeping your
   abook entries in a separate category, you can continue to add and
   modify entries in other categories manually, and pilot-addresses will
   not change or delete them.

Q: Can I use abook in UTF-8 terminal emulator?

A: Yes, the version 0.5.2 added a multibyte character support.

   There are currently some issues:

   - Addressbook files must have the same encoding as you use with abook.
     If you have used abook previously with ISO-8859-1 encoding you can
     convert the addressbook files with iconv(1). For example:

     $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 < ~/.abook/addressbook.old > \
     ~/.abook/addressbook.new

   - Filters will output strings using multibyte representation of the used
     locale. This is incorrect for (most of) filters. You can again use
     iconv to convert between encodings. Same goes with input filters. If
     you use UTF-8 charset the input is expected to be UTF-8 encoded.
